# pouchviewer
Made for LOTR 36.14 legacy on Minecraft version 1.7.10.

This LOTR addon reveals pouch contents by listing the quantity and name of each item in a pouch in the pouch's tooltip. It should also display items for most item container mods.

- 1.7 added item rarities, where items of your choosing can have configurable rarities/colors in the pouch tooltip! This should make it easier for you to find your valuables or to sift through loot pouches for coins. Settings can be found at 'Menu > Mods > LOTR Pouch Viewer > Config'

By default, 5 items are listed in the tooltip (can be changed in the config). This display resembles the Shulker Box tooltip that was added in later versions, so pouch contents don't overload the screen.

By pressing Left Shift, the player can reveal all pouch contents. The keybind can be changed at 'Options > Controls > scroll down to LOTR > show all items in tooltip'

If the show slot numbers config option is enabled, the slot number each item is in will also be displayed.

It also removes the "Dyed" and "Belonged to: name" text from all items to make tooltips less cluttered (can be toggled in the config)
