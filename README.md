# pouchviewer
Made for LOTR 36.14 legacy on Minecraft version 1.7.10.

This LOTR addon reveals pouch contents by listing the quantity and name of each item in a pouch in the pouch's tooltip. It should also display items for most item container mods.

By default, 5 items are listed in the tooltip. This display resembles the Shulker Box tooltip that was added in later versions, so pouch contents don't overload the screen.

By pressing Left Shift, the player can reveal all pouch contents.

If advanced tooltips is toggled on (F3 + H), the slot number each item is in will also be displayed.

It also removes the "Dyed" and "Belonged to: name" text from all items to make tooltips less cluttered.

The 'Items' text can be disabled in the config. The name of items can be moved before/after the quantity in the config. Rarities for specific items can be added in the config. Rarity colors, default item color, slot color, and 'Items' text color can be changed in the config.
