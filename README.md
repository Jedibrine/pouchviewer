# pouchviewer
This LOTR addon reveals pouch contents by listing the quantity and name of each item in a pouch in the pouch's tooltip. It should also display items for most item container mods.

By default, 5 items are listed in the tooltip. This display resembles the Shulker Box tooltip that was added in later versions, so pouch contents don't overload the screen. default1 default2
